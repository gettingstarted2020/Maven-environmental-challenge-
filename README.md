**About Project**

In 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality across its corporate operations. Apple accomplished this milestone through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency measures, and carbon offset projects. In 2020, Apple initiated its 2030 carbon neutrality plan, announcing its ambitious goal to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. Apple's plan focuses on reducing emissions by 75%, targeting a reduction to 9.6 million metric tons of CO2, and removing the remaining 25% through carbon removal projects.

**Task Assigned:**

For the Maven Environmental Challenge, I will be working as an independent journalist and data visualization enthusiast. My task is to use the data provided by Apple in their Environmental Progress Reports to visualize their progress toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.

**Data:**

Three datasets are provided to analyze Apple's progress toward carbon neutrality by 2030. The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contains the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022, divided by category (corporate and product life cycle), scope (direct scope 1 emissions and indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and type (emissions and removals). The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contains emissions from the product life cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022. The "Normalizing Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period.

**Tools Used:**

* Excel: For data cleaning and to forecast CO2 emissions from 2023 to 2030.

* Power BI: To visualize data and gain insights.

**Steps Included**

* Before beginning the analysis, it's crucial to understand the provided data by reviewing each file and understanding the different types of fields present.

* Data cleaning: Removing null values from the dataset.

* Visualization: Analyzing the data using 2015 as the baseline year. Specifying key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to assess the progress and success of the carbon neutrality program. Four important KPIs are included. Various charts like line charts, bar charts, and tree charts are used in Power BI to represent the trend of carbon emissions across various categories over the years.

* Excelâ€™s forecast sheets are used to predict future carbon emissions across its categories. Forecast sheets help predict if Apple can reach its 2030 target.

**Insights:**

* By 2022, Apple reduced its carbon emissions by 47.17% (~20.3 million metric tons of CO2e).

* Apple saw a 68.7% increase in revenue as of 2022, indicating that its sustainability program did not impact sales and boosted revenue.

* After 2019, corporate carbon emissions started to decline, and by 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality in its corporate operations.

* Product life cycle emissions also decreased gradually from 38 million metric tons in 2015 to 20.2 million in 2022.

* The segments that contributed the most to carbon emissions during the product life cycle are manufacturing (66.3% of total product life cycle carbon emissions), followed by product use (24.3%) and product transportation (9.4%). However, Apple's innovation has helped control emissions over the years.

* Apple's path toward net-zero carbon emissions not only benefited the environment but also boosted the company's revenue and market capitalization. In 2020, when Apple announced its 2030 carbon neutrality program, both revenue and market share grew.

* Through innovation, Apple has reduced the carbon footprint of its recent products over the years. The iPhone X had the highest carbon footprint (79 kg CO2e), but newer products have reduced this number. The recent iPhone 15 is recorded to have produced 56 kg CO2e, approximately equal to its older models like the iPhone 7 and 6s, indicating that innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand.

* Over the years, Apple also invested in carbon offset programs starting in 2020, which were able to reduce carbon emissions by 1.06 million metric tons of CO2e.

**Recommendation and Conclusion:**

Recommendation: Customers should be made aware and educated on how to optimize their devices to reduce their carbon footprint. Encouraging device recycling should also be a priority.

Apple's commitment to sustainability is commendable and serves as an inspiration for many businesses to reevaluate their operational practices. If Apple continues to invest in new innovations, both in the manufacturing process and in carbon offset programs, it is predicted that the company will achieve its goal of reducing carbon emissions to 9.6 million metric tons of CO2 by 2027. (This prediction was made using Excel forecast sheets with an 85% confidence interval.)
